# Pokémon Card Sales Analysis

This project is based on my experience buying and selling Pokémon cards.
I use this data to practise data analysis skills such as tracking prices,
calculating profit, and identifying trends.

Goals:
- Track purchase and sale prices
- Calculate profit and loss
- Analyse which cards sell best
- Practise Excel and Python for data analysis

# List of most valuable card names
cards = ["Mewtwo", "Cythnthia", "Ns Reshiram", ""]

# Purchase prices (£)
purchase_prices = [60.70, 68.20, 101.99, 46.00]

# Sale prices (£)
sale_prices = [170.69, 150.73, 133.17, 110.99]

# Calculate profit for each card
profits = []

for i in range(len(cards)):
    profit = sale_prices[i] - purchase_prices[i]
    profits.append(profit)
    print(cards[i], "profit: £", profit)

# Calculate average profit
average_profit = sum(profits) / len(profits)
print("Average profit per card: £", average_profit)

# Pokémon Card Price Trend Analysis
# This program analyses weekly price trends and flags cards
# that should be sold based on percentage drop.

cards = ["Mewtwo SM191", "Cynthia 228/236", "Tag Team 259/236", "Lucario"]

# Weekly price change (£)
price_change = [-2.65, -0.60, 0.90, -3.97]

# Weekly percentage change (%)
percentage_change = [-1.53, -0.39, 0.68, -3.45]

print("Weekly Pokémon Card Trend Analysis\n")

# Cards that should be sold this week
sell_this_week = []

for i in range(len(cards)):
    print(cards[i])
    print(" Price change: £", price_change[i])
    print(" Percentage change:", percentage_change[i], "%")
# Danger rule: must sell if drop is between -2.5% and -5%
    if percentage_change[i] <= -2.5 and percentage_change[i] >= -5:
        print("DANGER LEVEL: SELL THIS WEEK")
        sell_this_week.append(cards[i])
    else:
        print(" Status: Hold")

    print()

print("Summary:")
print("Cards to sell this week:", sell_this_week)
