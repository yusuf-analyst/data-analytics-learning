# Pokémon Card Sales Analysis

This project is based on my experience buying and selling Pokémon cards.
I use this data to practise data analysis skills such as tracking prices,
calculating profit, and identifying trends.

Goals:
- Track purchase and sale prices
- Calculate profit and loss
- Analyse which cards sell best
- Practise Excel and Python for data analysis

# List of most valuable card names
cards = ["Mewtwo", "Cythnthia", "Ns Reshiram", ""]

# Purchase prices (£)
purchase_prices = [60.70, 68.20, 101.99, 46.00]

# Sale prices (£)
sale_prices = [170.69, 150.73, 133.17, 110.99]

# Calculate profit for each card
profits = []

for i in range(len(cards)):
    profit = sale_prices[i] - purchase_prices[i]
    profits.append(profit)
    print(cards[i], "profit: £", profit)

# Calculate average profit
average_profit = sum(profits) / len(profits)
print("Average profit per card: £", average_profit)
