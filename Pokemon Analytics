# Pokémon Card Sales Analysis

This project is based on my experience buying and selling Pokémon cards.
I use this data to practise data analysis skills such as tracking prices,
calculating profit, and identifying trends.

Goals:
- Track purchase and sale prices
- Calculate profit and loss
- Analyse which cards sell best
- Practise Excel and Python for data analysis
